# Restaurant-Management-System
I was only able to make it work on the terminal. I was able to run it with ctrl + F5.
I was able to input The users names and they will automatically connect to their RoleID.

# User Role Credentials
Entering the Name John Doe will let you access Admin.
Entering the Name Jane Smith will let you access Manager.
Entering the Name Bob Brown will let you access Staff.

I was Able to add different menus depending on what Role you are logged in.
In the Admin Menu it has the Reports that you can view, it also has them managing other Users and Menu Items.

In the Manager Menu you can Assign Staff, Proccess orders, manage tables, and view table status.

Finally the Staff can take an order, generate a bill, and update a table status.

If it's easier to access using github then copying it from word text heres the link.
